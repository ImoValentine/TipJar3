# Sample Hardhat Project


TipJar3 💸
A simple Web3 tipping platform built with React, MetaMask, and Ethereum.
TipJar3 allows anyone to send Ethereum (ETH) directly to support the growth and scaling of Web3 applications — fully decentralized, transparent, and secure.

🚀 Features
💡 Web3 Ready — Connects directly to MetaMask for easy ETH transfers.

🔒 Decentralized — No middlemen or platforms holding your funds.

📜 Smart Contract Logic (Future-ready) — All rules live on-chain.

🌍 Transparent — Anyone can verify transactions via Etherscan.
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

⚙️ Tech Stack
React (Frontend UI)

ethers.js (Ethereum interaction)

MetaMask (Wallet integration)

Infura (Ethereum RPC Provider)

💡 How It Works
Connect your MetaMask wallet.

Check the balance of the project wallet.

Send ETH directly using the “Send a Tip” button.

All tips go straight to the contract or wallet address — fully verifiable on-chain.
